# Restaurant Management System

This repository contains the **Restaurant Management System**, developed during my internship at **Apexcify Technology**. The system is designed to streamline restaurant operations, offering features such as order processing, inventory control, and customer management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Order Management:** Create, update, and manage customer orders efficiently.
- **Inventory Tracking:** Monitor stock levels and alert when restocking is needed.
- **Table Reservations:** Allow management and tracking of table bookings.
- **Role-Based Access:** Distinct access for roles like staff, manager, and admin.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate insights with key performance reports.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for backend logic.
- **Express.js:** Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Database:** SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) backend for data storage.
- **ORM/ODM:** Sequelize (for SQL) or Mongoose (for MongoDB) to manage database operations.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions.
- **Password Security:** Bcrypt for password hashing and user account protection.
