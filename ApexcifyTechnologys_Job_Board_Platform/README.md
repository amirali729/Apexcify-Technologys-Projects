# Job Board Platform

This repository contains the **Job Board Platform**, developed during my internship at **Apexcify Technology**. The platform connects job seekers with employers, allowing for seamless job posting, application submissions, and user account management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Job Listings:** Employers can create, update, and delete job postings.
- **Job Applications:** Candidates can submit applications to available jobs.
- **User Authentication:** Secure account registration and login for both job seekers and employers.
- **Resume Uploads:** Users can upload resumes (e.g., PDF) when applying for jobs.
- **Role-Based Permissions:** Separate access controls for job seekers, employers, and admins.
- **Search & Filtering:** Efficient job search and filtering by category, location, and keywords.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express.js:** Framework for routing and API management.
- **Database:** SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) backend for storing users, job posts, and applications.
- **ORM/ODM:** Sequelize (SQL) or Mongoose (MongoDB) for database management.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing user sessions.
- **Password Encryption:** Bcrypt for hashing and validating user passwords.
- **File Uploads:** Multer or a similar middleware for managing resume uploads.
